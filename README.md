# CSE 164 Final Project 2026

## Semi-Supervised Classification and Semantic Segmentation

In this project, you will build a computer vision system that learns from:

- a small image-level labeled training set,
- a smaller segmentation-labeled training set,
- a large unlabeled training set.

Your model must predict two outputs for each hidden test image:

1. an image-level class label,
2. a pixel-level semantic segmentation mask.

The segmentation task carries most of the final score.

## Data

The dataset is in `data/`:

```text
data/
├── train_labeled/
│   └── images/
├── train_seg/
│   ├── images/
│   └── masks/
├── train_unlabeled/
│   └── images/
├── val/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── masks/
│   └── classification.json
├── test/
│   └── images/
└── metadata/
    ├── class_map.json
    ├── train_labeled.json
    └── train_seg.json
```

Dataset size:

- 300 target classes.
- 7,500 image-level labeled training images.
- 3,000 segmentation-labeled training images.
- 50,000 unlabeled training images. A small fraction are distractor images from non-target classes.
- 750 public validation images with labels and masks.
- 3,000 hidden test images.

## Labels

Classification labels are integer `class_id` values in `[0, 299]`.

Ground-truth segmentation masks are PNG images using this RGB encoding:

```python
segmentation_id = R + G * 256
```

Ground-truth mask ids:

- `0`: background or non-target category.
- `1..300`: foreground classes. `segmentation_id = class_id + 1`.
- `1000`: ignore region. These pixels are not scored.

Prediction masks may use only ids `0..300`; `1000` is reserved for ground-truth
ignore regions and will be rejected by the validator.

Every predicted mask must have exactly the same width and height as the
corresponding input image.

## Kaggle Submission Format

Submit one CSV file named like `submission.csv`:

```csv
image,class_id,segmentation_rle
test_00000.JPEG,17,1 20 18 210 5 18
test_00001.JPEG,3,
```

Columns:

- `image`: test image filename.
- `class_id`: predicted image-level class in `[0, 299]`.
- `segmentation_rle`: row-major 1-indexed run-length encoding of the predicted segmentation mask.

The RLE format stores non-background runs as triples:

```text
start length value start length value ...
```

`start` is 1-indexed after row-major flattening, `length` is the run length,
and `value` is the predicted segmentation id in `1..300`. Empty
`segmentation_rle` or `0` means an all-background mask.

## Evaluation

The final score is:

```text
Final score = 70% segmentation + 20% classification + 10% report/code reproducibility
```

The Kaggle leaderboard reports the automated model score only:

```text
Kaggle score = 70% segmentation + 20% classification
```

The remaining 10% report/code reproducibility component is graded separately.

The segmentation score is:

```text
Segmentation score =
  70% mean IoU
+ 20% boundary F-score
+ 10% rare-class mIoU
```

Classification is scored with macro accuracy.

Mean IoU and rare-class mIoU are computed over foreground classes only.
Background is not included in the class average.

## Starter Utilities

Install the small utility dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a baseline submission:

```bash
python starter/make_sample_submission_csv.py \
  --data-root data \
  --split test \
  --output sample_submission.csv
```

Validate a test submission format:

```bash
python starter/validate_submission_csv.py \
  --submission sample_submission.csv \
  --data-root data \
  --split test
```

Score on the public validation split:

```bash
python starter/make_sample_submission_csv.py \
  --data-root data \
  --split val \
  --output val_sample_submission.csv

python starter/validate_submission_csv.py \
  --submission val_sample_submission.csv \
  --data-root data \
  --split val
```

## Segmentation Training

Run the current full-data supervised baseline:

```bash
python scripts/train_seg.py --config configs/seg_train.yaml
```

Run the segmentation-heavy multi-task U-Net from scratch:

```bash
python scripts/train_seg.py --config configs/multitask_train.yaml
```

The multi-task model shares the U-Net encoder between a 301-channel
segmentation decoder and a 300-class classification head. Its default loss is:

```text
segmentation CE + 0.5 * foreground Dice + 0.1 * classification CE
```

It uses paired random crops and flips, image-only color jitter, AdamW, and a
per-step warmup plus cosine learning-rate schedule. On supported CUDA GPUs it
uses bfloat16 autocast while keeping model parameters and AdamW state in
float32. Gradient clipping and non-finite-loss checks stop unstable runs before
bad checkpoints propagate. No pretrained weights are used.

Verify the complete multi-task path on a tiny deterministic subset:

```bash
python scripts/train_seg.py --config configs/multitask_tiny_debug.yaml
```

Quick Mac smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/train_seg.py --config configs/seg_mac_quick.yaml
```

Tiny deterministic debug run:

```bash
python scripts/train_seg.py --config configs/seg_tiny_debug.yaml
```

Each config uses a distinct output directory. Training refuses to replace an
existing run's checkpoints or metrics by default. Prefer changing `output_dir`
for each experiment. To intentionally replace a run, add
`--overwrite-output`.

Resume an interrupted multi-task run:

```bash
python scripts/train_seg.py \
  --config configs/multitask_train.yaml \
  --resume outputs/multitask_unet_256_100ep_warmup/last.pt
```

Generate both required prediction outputs from a multi-task checkpoint:

```bash
python scripts/make_submission.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/multitask_unet_256_100ep_warmup/best.pt \
  --output submission.csv
```

## Allowed Resources

You may use:

- Course materials.
- Public Python packages and model architecture code.
- Coding assistants such as Codex or Claude Code.
- Public documentation for libraries and models.

You may not:

- Use pretrained checkpoints, pretrained weights, pretrained backbones, or
  foundation-model outputs/features, unless the instructors explicitly provide
  them to the whole class.
- Search for, recover, or use hidden test labels or masks.
- Manually label the hidden test set.
- Upload the hidden test set to a human labeling service.
- Submit predictions generated by another team.
- Use private data or annotations that are not available to the whole class unless the instructors explicitly approve them.

Your report must describe what data, model architectures, packages, and external
tools you used.

## Suggested Directions

Strong projects will usually need more than direct supervised training on the
segmentation-labeled images. Possible directions include:

- Training a segmentation model from scratch with strong augmentation.
- Multi-task learning with a shared encoder.
- Pseudo-labeling high-confidence unlabeled images.
- Confidence filtering for distractor images.
- Test-time augmentation and model ensembling.
- Boundary-aware losses or post-processing.
- Class-balanced sampling for rare classes.

You are not required to use any particular architecture.
